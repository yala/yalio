# Personal Website
This is the web repo for my website ( adamyala.csail.mit.edu ). It's fairly easy to customize, so you're welcome to fork it and use it yourself. All background images were sourced from unsplash.com. 

To change the background images, and the prof image, place your images in the public folder, and link to them in `client/styles/_vars.scss`. If you want to add publications / change them, edit the `private/publications.json` file. Similarly, you can specify the projects in the `private/projects.json` file.

To change the bio / advisor / groups bit in the header, You can change that content in `client/templates.tpl.jade`.
